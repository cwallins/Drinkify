            This project originally aimed to use APIs and frameworks to create a dynamic web application.
            <br />
            By using this site you can browse and store your favorite drinks in the web's local storage.

            The project group is now re-structuring this project from last autumn - 22 for the course: Individuell FÃ¶rdjupning.
            The code has been re-written to follow React standards and has implemented standard hooks throughout to make it better. 
            <br />
            <br /> Furthermore, we have created a version with custom hooks that investigates if the use of those in a project like
            this is benefitial. 
            <br />
            <br />
            Happy Drink Hunting!
